# vue-app

A small vue app I created by following [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-vue/) to learn Vue.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
